# Mock values for PrepareLonghornDisksStep - Pre-mounted Single Disk
# Since we're using CLUSTER_PREMOUNTED_DISKS, no mounting commands are executed.
# The step only checks for existing longhorn-disk.cfg and replicas directory,
# which are file system operations handled by the fsops package in dry-run mode.
