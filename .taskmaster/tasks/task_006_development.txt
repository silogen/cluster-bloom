# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Network Policy Management and Advanced Networking Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and integrate network policy management, security policies, resource quotas, and traffic control to enhance cluster security and networking capabilities.
# Details:
Implement Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resources to control pod-to-pod and pod-to-external communication. Design a CLI or UI module for creating, updating, and deleting network policies using YAML manifests, supporting pod selectors, namespace selectors, ingress/egress rules, and policy types. Integrate with advanced CNI plugins (e.g., Calico, Cilium) to enable Layer 3-7 policy enforcement and traffic control. Add support for resource quotas at the namespace level to limit resource consumption and prevent noisy neighbor issues. Implement traffic control features such as rate limiting and bandwidth restrictions using Kubernetes annotations or CNI plugin capabilities. Ensure policies are additive and provide a mechanism for default deny-all policies with explicit allow rules. Include documentation and examples for common security scenarios, such as restricting database access to specific services or enforcing namespace isolation. Provide mechanisms for policy validation and dry-run testing before enforcement.

# Test Strategy:
1. Deploy a test cluster with the selected CNI plugin and apply various network policies using the management interface. 2. Verify that only allowed pod-to-pod and pod-to-external communications succeed, and all other traffic is blocked as intended. 3. Test resource quotas by deploying workloads that attempt to exceed set limits and confirm enforcement. 4. Validate traffic control by simulating high-traffic scenarios and ensuring rate limits/bandwidth caps are respected. 5. Use automated scripts to apply, update, and remove policies, confirming correct behavior and no unintended connectivity. 6. Review logs and metrics to ensure policy enforcement and auditability. 7. Test policy validation and dry-run features to ensure errors are caught before enforcement.
