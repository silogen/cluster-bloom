# Task ID: 7
# Title: Add High Availability Configuration Support for etcd and Control Plane Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement high availability (HA) configuration options for etcd and Kubernetes control plane components to ensure cluster resilience and fault tolerance.
# Details:
Design and implement support for deploying etcd in a highly available cluster topology, following best practices such as using an odd number of nodes (e.g., 3, 5, or 7) and distributing them across failure domains to prevent single points of failure. Integrate configuration options to allow users to select between stacked (local) and external etcd cluster modes, and automate the provisioning and joining of etcd members using kubeadm or equivalent tooling. Extend the control plane deployment logic to support multiple control plane nodes, ensuring proper load balancing and failover for kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, and kube-scheduler. Update configuration schemas and validation logic to enforce HA requirements (e.g., minimum node counts, endpoint lists, certificate distribution). Provide clear documentation and automation scripts for deploying, scaling, and monitoring HA etcd and control plane setups. Ensure secure communication between all components using TLS, leveraging the certificate management system.

# Test Strategy:
1. Deploy a test cluster with HA etcd (minimum 3 nodes) and multiple control plane nodes using the new configuration options. 2. Simulate node failures (e.g., shutting down etcd or control plane nodes) and verify that the cluster remains operational and consistent. 3. Validate that configuration validation logic correctly enforces HA requirements and rejects invalid setups. 4. Confirm that all control plane components communicate securely and that certificates are correctly distributed and rotated. 5. Use monitoring tools to verify health and failover behavior of etcd and control plane components during disruptions.
