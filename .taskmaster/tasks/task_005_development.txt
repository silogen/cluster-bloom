# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Automated Certificate Lifecycle Management for Cluster
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and integrate automated certificate lifecycle management to enable seamless certificate issuance, renewal, and rotation within the cluster, minimizing manual intervention and reducing the risk of outages due to expired certificates.
# Details:
Design and implement a certificate lifecycle management system that automates the discovery, issuance, renewal, and rotation of all cluster certificates. Integrate with both public and private certificate authorities (CAs) as needed, and ensure compatibility with Kubernetes-native tools such as kubeadm for certificate management. Implement automation scripts or controllers that monitor certificate expiration dates, trigger renewal processes before expiry, and rotate certificates across cluster components without downtime. Provide a unified dashboard or reporting mechanism for certificate inventory, expiration status, and compliance checks. Ensure that certificate management processes are policy-driven, support short-lived certificates, and align with DevSecOps best practices. Document procedures for integrating with external PKI solutions and for handling emergency certificate revocation and replacement.

# Test Strategy:
1. Deploy the automated certificate management system in a test cluster and verify that all certificates are discovered and inventoried. 2. Simulate certificate expiration and confirm that the system automatically renews and rotates certificates without service disruption. 3. Test integration with both internal and external CAs, ensuring successful issuance and renewal. 4. Validate that the dashboard or reporting tool accurately reflects certificate status and compliance. 5. Perform a manual revocation and replacement scenario to ensure emergency procedures work as intended. 6. Review logs and audit trails to confirm all certificate operations are tracked and compliant with security policies.
