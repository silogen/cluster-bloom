# Task ID: 3
# Title: Add Built-in Monitoring Stack Deployment with Prometheus and Grafana
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate automated deployment of a monitoring stack using Prometheus and Grafana, including Kubernetes manifests and installation scripts.
# Details:
Leverage the kube-prometheus-stack to provide a comprehensive monitoring solution for the Kubernetes cluster. Create Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for deploying Prometheus and Grafana, ensuring they are organized under a dedicated namespace (e.g., 'monitoring'). Use the Prometheus Operator to manage Prometheus deployment, configure RBAC permissions, and set up ServiceMonitors for scraping cluster metrics. Include manifests for persistent storage, services, and ingress (if required). Automate installation steps via a script or Makefile target that applies all manifests in the correct order. Provide default Grafana dashboards and configure data sources to connect to Prometheus. Document all steps and configuration options for customization. Ensure the solution is compatible with clusters using RBAC and supports both manual and automated deployment workflows.[1][3][4][5]

# Test Strategy:
1. Deploy the monitoring stack on a test Kubernetes cluster using the provided manifests and automation script. 2. Verify that Prometheus and Grafana pods are running and healthy in the 'monitoring' namespace. 3. Confirm that Prometheus is scraping cluster metrics and that Grafana is able to display these metrics using prebuilt dashboards. 4. Test access to the Grafana UI via port-forwarding or ingress and validate login with default credentials. 5. Simulate a pod or node failure and verify that alerts are generated in Prometheus and visible in Grafana. 6. Review logs and resource usage to ensure stability and performance.
