# Task ID: 9
# Title: Add CentOS/RHEL Compatibility for Multi-OS Cluster Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: low
# Description: Extend the platform to support CentOS and RHEL operating systems in addition to existing Ubuntu-only compatibility, enabling multi-OS Kubernetes cluster deployments.
# Details:
Refactor installation scripts, configuration management, and automation tooling to detect and handle CentOS/RHEL environments alongside Ubuntu. Update package installation logic to use the appropriate package managers (yum/dnf for CentOS/RHEL, apt for Ubuntu) and ensure all dependencies, kernel modules, and system configurations are correctly applied for each OS. Adapt systemd service files, SELinux/AppArmor policies, and firewall rules to account for CentOS/RHEL-specific requirements. Validate compatibility of Kubernetes components (kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl) and CNI plugins on CentOS/RHEL. Update documentation to include OS-specific setup instructions and troubleshooting. Ensure that the cluster provisioning workflow can mix and match supported OS types, and that node labels/taints reflect the underlying OS for scheduling and policy enforcement.

# Test Strategy:
1. Provision test clusters with CentOS, RHEL, and mixed CentOS/Ubuntu nodes. 2. Run the full cluster installation and configuration workflow, verifying successful deployment and operation of all Kubernetes components on each OS. 3. Deploy sample workloads and confirm correct scheduling and networking across OS types. 4. Validate that OS-specific system services, security policies, and package dependencies are correctly configured. 5. Run conformance and smoke tests to ensure cluster stability and feature parity with Ubuntu-based deployments. 6. Review documentation for accuracy and completeness regarding CentOS/RHEL support.
