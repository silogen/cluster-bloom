        "testStrategy": "1. Provision test clusters on AWS, Azure, and GCP using the implemented modules, verifying successful creation, configuration, and accessibility of each cluster. 2. Validate that cloud-native features (e.g., load balancers, storage, IAM integration) are correctly configured and functional. 3. Test cluster scaling and deletion workflows for each provider. 4. Attempt hybrid deployments (e.g., clusters in multiple clouds) and confirm unified management and monitoring. 5. Review audit logs and credential handling for security compliance. 6. Document and resolve any provider-specific errors or incompatibilities encountered during testing.",
