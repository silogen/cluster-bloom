For every exported function, write unit tests following Go conventions: each test function should be named TestFunctionName and accept *testing.T as a parameter. Use table-driven tests to cover a variety of input scenarios and edge cases. Where functions interact with external dependencies or side effects, define interfaces and use mocking frameworks (such as mockery or gomock) to simulate those dependencies, ensuring tests remain isolated and deterministic. Leverage subtests with t.Run for complex functions to organize related test cases. Ensure all tests are clear, maintainable, and verify observable behavior rather than internal implementation details. Follow Go best practices for test organization and naming conventions[1][2][4].",
