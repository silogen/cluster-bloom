# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Cloud Provider Integration for AWS, Azure, and GCP
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop integration modules for AWS, Azure, and GCP to enable cloud-native Kubernetes cluster deployment and management across all three providers.
# Details:
Design and implement provider-specific modules that abstract the APIs and infrastructure requirements for AWS (EKS), Azure (AKS), and GCP (GKE). Use each provider's SDK or CLI tools (e.g., AWS SDK/eksctl, Azure SDK/az CLI, Google Cloud SDK/gcloud) to automate cluster provisioning, scaling, and lifecycle management. Implement a unified interface in the platform to allow users to select a cloud provider, configure cluster parameters (region, node pools, networking, authentication), and trigger deployments. Ensure integration with cloud-native features such as load balancers, persistent storage, and IAM roles. Support hybrid and multi-cloud deployments by leveraging infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform for consistent provisioning across providers. Provide mechanisms for secure credential management and audit logging of cloud operations. Document provider-specific limitations and best practices for cluster management.

# Test Strategy:
1. Provision test clusters on AWS, Azure, and GCP using the implemented modules, verifying successful creation, configuration, and accessibility of each cluster. 2. Validate that cloud-native features (e.g., load balancers, storage, IAM integration) are correctly configured and functional. 3. Test cluster scaling and deletion workflows for each provider. 4. Attempt hybrid deployments (e.g., clusters in multiple clouds) and confirm unified management and monitoring. 5. Review audit logs and credential handling for security compliance. 6. Document and resolve any provider-specific errors or incompatibilities encountered during testing.
